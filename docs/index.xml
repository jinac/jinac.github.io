      <description>Introduction Deep learning model deployment doesn&amp;rsquo;t end with the training of a model. Especially with edge devices and the variety of processors, there can be many steps to get a network running on an embedded device. With the OpenCV AI Kit, I have camera modules with a Myriad X chip on the same board. It is a module well-suited for deep learning inference with what should be minimal bottleneck of image data transfer.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m John.
I grew up in Tampa, FL but I now live in San Francisco, CA.
I was a Research Engineer at Ditto, a SaaS company that provides virtual try-on software in the eyewear, and a Machine Learning Engineer at Occipital, a company producing a stereo camera sensor and software for 3D sensing and SLAM. For more about this, check out my resume
I am also a Composer and Multi-Instrumentalist.</description>
