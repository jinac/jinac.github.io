Hi, I'm John.

I grew up in Tampa, FL but I now live in San Francisco, CA.

I was a Research Engineer at [Ditto](https://ditto.com/), a SaaS company that provides virtual try-on software in the eyewear, and a Machine Learning Engineer at [Occipital](https://occipital.com/), a company producing a stereo camera sensor and software for 3D sensing and SLAM. For more about this, check out my [resume](/resume)

I am also a Composer and Multi-Instrumentalist. For more on that, check out [music](/music)

I also train in Taekwondo and sometimes volunteer to teach at the school I attend. Currently, I'm a 1-Dan Black Belt.
